## EXAMPLE #1 = Randomization test for difference between two means (t-test). 
##when waiting to get someone's parking space, that the driver you are waiting for is taking longer than necessary?
##They hung out in parking lots and recorded the time that it took for a car to leave a parking place. They broke the data down on the basis of whether or not someone in another car was waiting for the space
##I will begin using the mean difference as my statistic, and compare with the t statistic for the same purpose.

## students to answer SAT-type questions (Score) without having read the passage on which those questions were based.
